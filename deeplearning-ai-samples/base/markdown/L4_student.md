4. DesignThinking plugin ... Here you are

# üî• Get a kernel ready


```python
import semantic_kernel as sk
from semantic_kernel.connectors.ai.open_ai import AzureChatCompletion, OpenAIChatCompletion
from IPython.display import display, Markdown

kernel = sk.Kernel()

useAzureOpenAI = False

if useAzureOpenAI:
    deployment, api_key, endpoint = sk.azure_openai_settings_from_dot_env()
    kernel.add_text_completion_service("azureopenai", AzureChatCompletion(deployment, endpoint, api_key))
else:
    api_key, org_id = sk.openai_settings_from_dot_env()
    kernel.add_text_completion_service("openai", OpenAIChatCompletion("gpt-3.5-turbo-0301", api_key, org_id))

print("A kernel is now ready.")

## ‚ú® The categorized observations from the 'Empathize' + 'Define' + 'Ideate' + 'Prototype' + phases of design thinking
1. Regular cleaning and maintenance of seating areas: Create a cleaning schedule with specific tasks and assign responsibilities to employees. Use a paper checklist to track completion of tasks and note any issues that need to be addressed.

2. Offer discounts for customers who bring their own seating cushions: Create a paper coupon that can be handed out to customers who bring their own cushions. The coupon should clearly state the discount amount and any restrictions.

3. Introduce a loyalty program for repeat customers: Create a paper loyalty card that can be stamped or punched each time a customer makes a purchase. The card should have clear instructions on how to earn rewards and what those rewards are.

4. Train servers to be knowledgeable about menu offerings: Create a paper training manual that includes detailed information about each menu item, including ingredients, preparation methods, and suggested pairings. Use quizzes or role-playing exercises to test server knowledge.

5. Offer free garlic bread with every pizza order: Create a paper coupon that can be handed out to customers with their pizza order. The coupon should clearly state the offer and any restrictions.

6. Add calzones to the menu: Create a paper menu insert that includes the new calzone options. The insert should be visually appealing and clearly labeled as "New Menu Items."

7. Implement a feedback system for customers to share their experiences: Create a paper feedback form that can be handed out to customers with their bill. The form should include questions about the customer's experience, as well as space for comments and suggestions.

8. Offer a gluten-free pizza option: Create a paper menu insert that includes the new gluten-free pizza option. The insert should be visually appealing and clearly labeled as "Gluten-Free Options."

9. Introduce a delivery service: Create a paper delivery menu that includes all menu items available for delivery, as well as delivery fees and minimum order amounts. The menu should be visually appealing and easy to read.

10. Host events and promotions to attract new customers: Create a paper flyer or poster advertising the event or promotion. The flyer should include all relevant details, such as date, time, location, and any special offers or discounts.

### ‚ú® As an AI language model, I cannot predict the exact reactions of the 40-year old man in this scenario. However, some possible reactions could be:

- They might feel indifferent and not care about the loyalty card.
- They might feel annoyed or frustrated that they have to keep track of points and rewards.
- They might feel intrigued and motivated to earn rewards by visiting the bar more often.
- They might feel grateful and appreciated for being offered a loyalty program.
- They might feel confused or overwhelmed by the details of the loyalty card and need clarification.
